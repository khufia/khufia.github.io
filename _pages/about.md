I'm a Masters student in Computer Vision at [Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/). I received my Integrated Masters degree in Computer Science from [IIIT Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/) in 2024. My research focuses on computer vision, deep learning, and multimodal AI systems.

ðŸ“¢ I'm passionate about vision-language models, spatio-temporal understanding, and visualization recommendation systems. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaboration!
