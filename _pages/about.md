I'm a Masters student in Computer Vision at [Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) advised by [Zhiqiang Shen](https://zhiqiangshen.com/) and [Salman Khan](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/). I received my Integrated Masters degree in Computer Science from [IIIT Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/) in 2024. My research centers on multimodal models and agentic grounding, with an emphasis on enabling intelligent systems to perceive, reason, and act across diverse modalities in grounded environments.

ðŸ“¢ I'm passionate about vision-language models, spatio-temporal understanding, and visualization recommendation systems. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaboration!
